### Tool for an integrated analysis workflow in Vibrational Spectroscopy

Our Python library is specialised in the application of machine and deep learning (ML/DL) in the field of biospectroscopic applications. 
In recent years, most of the applications have been based on proprietary software solutions that were in the way of the FAIR principles of open science.
With strong scientific partners from the USA, England, Norway and Germany we want to pave the way for a free source code use of the common standards and latest deep learning models in biospectroscopy.

### Methods and models which are included

OpenVibSpec offers the possibility to handle everything from data import of raw measurements to ML/DL based data analysis in one ecosystem. We draw on established groundwork in the Python ecosystem to guarantee the best possible longevity.

#### Infrared-based biospectroscopy 
At this point, a distinction can be made between the fields of the established ML models and the new DL models. The former is based on the model-based correction of Mie scattering. The Mie correction based worflow is based on the fundamental paradigm of making the data understandable to the individual domain experts from spectroscopy. There are several options for correcting Mie scattering, all of which we would like to introduce. But first, for an overview, see Fig.1., here we see what the workflow is based on.

In short:
1) After the measurement, the raw data is imported into OpenVibSpec.
2) The correction of the Mie scattering in OpenVibSpec.
3) Selection of the training data and the training of the machine learning algorithms in OpenVibSpec.
